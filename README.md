# What's Ruby

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented
programming.  It has many features to process text files and to do system
management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and
extensible.

## Features of Ruby

*   Simple Syntax
*   **Normal** Object-oriented Features (e.g. class, method calls)
*   **Advanced** Object-oriented Features (e.g. Mix-in, Singleton-method)
*   Operator Overloading
*   Exception Handling
*   Iterators and Closures
*   Garbage Collection
*   Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)
*   Highly Portable (works on many Unix-like/POSIX compatible platforms as
    well as Windows, Mac OS X, Haiku, etc.) cf.

## How to compile and install

This is what you need to do to compile and install Ruby:

1.  If you want to use Microsoft Visual C++ to compile ruby, read
    [win32/README.win32](win32/README.win32) instead of this document.

2.  If `./configure` does not exist or is older than configure.in, run
    `autoconf` to (re)generate configure.

3.  Run `./configure`, which will generate `config.h` and `Makefile`.

    Some C compiler flags may be added by default depending on your
    environment.  Specify `optflags=..` and `warnflags=..` as necessary to
    override them.

4.  Edit `defines.h` if you need. Usually this step will not be needed.

5.  Remove comment mark(`#`) before the module names from `ext/Setup` (or add
    module names if not present), if you want to link modules statically.

    If you don't want to compile non static extension modules (probably on
    architectures which do not allow dynamic loading), remove comment mark
    from the line "`#option nodynamic`" in `ext/Setup`.

    Usually this step will not be needed.

6.  Run `make`.

    * On Mac, set RUBY\_CODESIGN environment variable with a signing identity.
      It uses the identity to sign `ruby` binary. See also codesign(1).

7.  Optionally, run '`make check`' to check whether the compiled Ruby
    interpreter works well. If you see the message "`check succeeded`", your
    ruby works as it should (hopefully).

8.  Run '`make install`'

    This command will create the following directories and install files into
    them.

    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/bin`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/include/ruby-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/include/ruby-${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/site_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/${PLATFORM}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib/ruby/gems/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/share/man/man1`
    *   `${DESTDIR}${prefix}/share/ri/${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${TEENY}/system`


    If Ruby's API version is '*x.y.z*', the `${MAJOR}` is '*x*', the
    `${MINOR}` is '*y*', and the `${TEENY}` is '*z*'.

    **NOTE**: teeny of the API version may be different from one of Ruby's
    program version

    You may have to be a super user to install ruby.


If you fail to compile ruby, please send the detailed error report with the
error log and machine/OS type, to help others.

Some extension libraries may not get compiled because of lack of necessary
external libraries and/or headers, then you will need to run '`make distclean-ext`'
to remove old configuration after installing them in such case.

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
